# C for Consensus Platform Development README

Welcome to the development repository for the "C for Consensus" social media platform. This README provides a detailed outline of the steps involved in building the platform, from defining requirements to maintaining and updating the system post-launch. Each step is crucial for ensuring the successful development and launch of the platform.
